# Quake MegaMod
Quake MegaMod is a collection of mods  for mutliplayer deathmatch, and is compatiable with Quake Remastered

## Mod Details
This changes the weapons and gameplay features of Quake (id1) maps.
Current Modifications Include:
* Grapple Hook: impulse 24 & 25 both extend and break the chain
* Super Laser Gun (Select Super Shot Gun twice): Fire two lasers. A classic mod that was either featured on the regular shotgun, or the super shotgun at the cost of 5 shells
* Trip Wire Gun (Select Super Nail Gun twice): Attach a trip wire on the wall that can be destoryed with rockets at the costs if 50 nails
* Cluster Grenade Gun (Select Grenade Launcher twice): Classic cluster grendade launcher, turns into a cluster of grenades that do 50% regular damage (The one I origionally remember would'nt explode on impact, but this will do until I can figure out how to get it to bounce, then cluster explode)
* Flare Gun (Select Grenade Launcher three times): A grenade that functions as a light source for a minute, which is useful for when someone turns the lights off (see Light Controller weapon)
* Homing Rocket Launcher (Select Rocket Launcher twice): A homing rocket that will fly around and avoid walls until it starts tracking someone
* BFG (Select Lightning Gun twice): Classic BFG, a slow moving lava ball that kills everyone in a small radius on impact. Costs 25 cells. (I might make this cost 50 cells, and double the radius)
* Light Controller (Select Lightning Gun three times): A classic mod I remember would allow players to vote to turn the lights on and off. Since the vote used impulse commands, to keep things it accessiable to console players I created this weapon instead

3. Also, if it doesn't already exist, create another folder called "mod"
4. Extract the contents of the ZIP into the folder called "id1" created in step 2. Plese back up or delete and existing files in this folder before extracting

## How to play
1. Once in game, open the console and type > bind f10 "game mod"
2. Whenever you launch Quake and want to start a server with this mod, press f10 before starting the server. 
Note: If you forget to press F10 and your game has already started, press Esc, then select "End Game" and once your back at the lobby screen press F10

## Notes
This is my first ever Quake server mod. I used to make maps for this game back in 1999-2002, and though server mods were neat. I just didn't have the resources to learn how to do it. Now almost 20 years later, I finally took the time and made this. It's more or less a tribute to all the old mods I remember from back then.

Speical thanks to JPiolho, Dan the Man, and the Quake Mapping Discord Community. I started this project not even knowing how to compile a Quake server mod, so it was a lot of fun for me.
